    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
    <h3>Goal</h3> 
      <p>Software development outside of a university class involves code
      that spans decades (Windows is 27 years old!), teams that span
      countries, and a lot of bottom-up project management and
      decision-making. Our goal is to help you grow your software
      development skills by providing an experience that matches real world
      software development as closely as possible. Think of it as a bit of
      an internship during the semester, with a strong mentoring component.
      We hope that this will be a different kind of class, in a good
      way.</p>

      <p>Specifically, by the end of the course:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You will have experience contributing to a real-world, large-scale software project.</li>
        <li>You will have participated in a geographically disparate development team, coordinating online.</li>
        <li>You will be familiar with large-scale project workflow using git.</li>
        <li>You will have practiced debugging unfamiliar systems.</li>
        <li>You will gain an understanding about open source project management.</li>
        <li>You will be confident finding and fixing bugs in other people's code, and contributing the fix back to the project.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Course Elements</h3>

      <p><b>Team Projects.</b> This class is being taught in conjunction
      with several universities and <a href="projects.html">open source
        projects</a>. Each of you will be on a team with other students
      (from MIT and elsewhere) working on one of those projects. Your
      mentored by the teaching team and a representative from the open
      source project.</p>

      <p>Student teams will work on improving their projects in two ways.
      First, by fixing "low hanging fruit" bugs that already exist, to get
      up to speed. Then, by identifying and pursuing new functionality for
      the project.</p> 

      <p><b>Hands-On Lectures.</b> For the first few weeks, Monday lectures
      will contain exercises that help you develop project workflow,
      debugging, and software design skills.</p>

      <p><b>Guest Lectures.</b> Guest lectures will be held occasionally to
      provide perspective on software development from the view of
      industry. We expect to cover topics such as open source business
      models and working with remote teams.</p>

      <p><b>Weekly Agile Meetings.</b> For the majority of the semester,
      class time will be used to hold mentoring and agile project
      management meetings.</p>

      <h3>Course Schedule</h3>
      <p>The full calendar is available <a href="calendar.html">here</a> but the rough outline for the semester is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Week 1</b> <i>- Bootup</i><br />Teams choose a name, collaboration framework, and create a simple project homepage.</li>
        <li><b>Every Week</b> <i>- Progress report.</i><br />Teams post a short update on their progress from the last week along with any links to demos to the FB group for the course.</li>
        <li><b>1/3 Point</b> <i>- Software demos and rapid prototypes due.</i><br />Students show their classmates what they've accomplished so far and get feedback on future implementations</li>
        <li><b>2/3 Point</b> <i>- Software demos and "Contract of Deliverables"</i><br />Other students are encouraged to use the software and report
 and any enhancement requests using a issue tracking tool of
ce provided by the student team. Students, teaching team, and mentors collaborate to produce a description of the software that will be completed and how the functionality will be validated.</li>
        <li><b>Final</b> <i>- Software Delivery</i><br />At the end of the course, we publish the project outcomes by team name. There is no final exam, but expectations for what was developed should be very clear from the weekly meetings.</li>
      </ul>

      

      <h3>Grading Policy</h3>

      The relative contributions to your grade will be:

      <ul>
        
        <li><b>75%</b> <i>- The code you contribute to the open source
          project you are working for.</i><br />Our goal is to provide a
        real-world learning experience, so we will try to grade you like a
        manager would. Your code will be graded based upon: <ul>
          <li>Whether it meets the functional expectations you have set in
          weekly meetings and planning documents
          <li>Its robustness, and your responsiveness to any bug tickets filed about your code</li>
          <li>The code quality, design, and project management skills you have demonstrated</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>15%</b> <i>- Class participation and activities.</i>
        <li><b>10%</b> <i>- Group participation.</i> <br />Attendance and participation in your project group.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For any non-group work, each student has a total of 5 slack days to
      use throughout the semester. In unusual or emergency circumstances,
      contact a member of the teaching team to discuss an extension, which we
      will provide if appropriate.</p>

      <p>Group projects cannot be turned in late under any circumstances. If
      you experience problems in your team, either due to team dynamics,
      absences, or any reason, contact the teaching team for advice on how
      to proceed.</p>

      <p>In line with the Departmental Guidelines Relating to Academic
      Honesty, here are our expectations regarding collaboration and
      sharing. This class involves almost exclusively group work. You may
      draw upon ideas from anywhere to complete this work, but the work you
      perform must be your own. Any material or code taken from external
      sources should be properly attributed. (If a block of code is
      borrowed from Stack Overflow, for example, full attribution with a
      back-link should be made in the code comments.) </p>
      
      <p>While the projects are a fully collaborative effort, we expect each
      member of the team to participate in every phase of development, and
      we will expect to see code authorship in particular attributed to the
      different team members. We will use the commit logs in the version
      control method of your choice as a primary guide to measure code
      contribution.</p>
      
      <p>Except in the context of a project team, you may not reuse any
      materials that were developed by other students in the course, in
      this term or previous terms, nor may you provide work for other
      students to copy. Copying work, or knowingly making work available
      for copying, is a serious offense that may result in reduced grades,
      failing the course, and disciplinary action.</p>

      <h3>Credit</h3>

      <p>This class provides 12 credits and 12 Engineering Design Points.
      It counts as a lab for EECS.</p>
