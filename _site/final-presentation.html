    <h1>Final Presentation</h1>

    <h4>When</h4>

    <p>Final presentations will be on Monday, May 6 and Wednesday, May 8. We'll
    do three presentations one day and two the other. Please email me to let me
    know your preference.</p>

    <p>Everyone must attend both days. If you can't attend one day, make sure
    you email me in advance (and make sure that's not the day your group is
    presenting.)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Monday: ______, ______</li>
      <li>Wednesday: MongoDB, Ruby on Rails, ______</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What</h4>

    <p>Provide a <b>debrief</b> of your project, with four main components:
    
    <ul>

      <li><b>Introduction.</b> A concise introduction of the project you worked on. (Even though you are all familiar with each other's work, we may have some guests visiting the final presentations.) 
      <ul>
        <li>What is it?</li>
        <li>Why do people use it?</li>
        <li>What software architecture does it employ? (language? client? server? client-server?)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Accomplishments.</b> Describe what you worked on this semester:
      <ul>

        <li>List your group's accomplishments. Don't sell your self short.
        Instead of saying "we fixed some bugs", list those bugs for us. No bug
        is too small.</li>

        <li>Give us the context around the accomplishment. If it is a bug fix,
        what was the error it fixed and what is a narrative of a situation your
        fix prevents?</li>

        <li>If appropriate, feel free to show a demo or high-level code
        example.</li>

        <li><b>Tip</b>: It's great to walk the audience <i>through</i> the steps required to make something happen, with code examples or diagrams. I.e., "First the server sends this message. Then the client catches it. Now a choice happens. If this event occurs, then this other thing will happen.. but here's the bug! So we need to figure out how to resolve this while still retaining this other functionality... " etc.</li>

      </ul></li>

     <li><b>Team Structure Takeaways.</b> How did your remote team and mentors
     work with you? How did the core team (not counting you) work together?
     Consider meetings, information exchange, bug tracking, feature
     discussions, feature planning, etc.

     <ul>

       <li>What are some aspects of this that seemed to work well. A good
       heuristic for this is whether you would replicated it in your own
       project.</li>

       <li>What are some aspects that you think need improvement?</li>

       <li>Pick one or two major take-aways that you think the rest of the
       class should hear. (e.g.: "having mentor 'office hours' is a really good
       idea since creates a casual atmosphere" or "this part of code reviews is
       helpful, but this part isn't")</li>

     </ul></li>

     <li><b>Project and Code Structure Takeaways.</b> Tell us about the code design 
     from a high level, with a similar approach to the team structure takeaways.
     <ul>

       <li>What are some aspects of the way your project code is organized that
       you think was great? Their use of a particular framework? Support
       libraries for defining APIs? Their coding style? Which parts will you
       seek to replicate on future projects?</li>

       <li>What aspects weren't great? What did you have a hard time with?
       Don't be shy: if something was challenging, weird, or hard, it's
       interesting to talk about.</li>

       <li>Anything cool/interesting that you think everyone should hear about
       coding style or architecture?</li>
     </ul>
    </li>

    <h4>Mechanics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Who?</b> One presentation per group. Everyone in the group should speak.</li>
      <li><b>Time.</b> Shoot for between 15 and 20 minutes. Larger groups should err on the side of more content to present.</li>
      <li><b>Code.</b> Unlike Design Reviews, code is not required. If you
      include code, it must fit on the slide in at least 16pt font. Pseudocode
      encouraged: think high-level. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Final Note</h4>

    <p>Each of you was dealt a completely different hand of cards with this
    class, and I am really proud of how played them. Some projects have been
    one big task, others a series of small ones. Some well defined, others
    open-ended. Several of you have started something, and then realized later
    it needed to be re-designed or even abandoned due to information you later
    learned.</p>
    
    <p>You've all worked hard and done great work, and you've helped the larger
    community during the process.  Every one of you deserves to be proud of the
    work you'll present.</p>
