    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <p>A way for you practice communicating, critiquing, and
    iterating technical design.

    <h4>High Level Process</h4>
    <p>Each Wednesday, four individuals (or pairs)
    will present a technical design and implementation that they have worked
    on. This means you can expect to present roughly once every three
    weeks.</p>

    <h4>Presenter Role</h4>
    <p>When you are acting as presenter, your role is to
    communicate your work in a way that both conveys its technical design and
    also the reason why this work was necessary. A presentation should last
    about ten minutes. A good breakdown for these ten minutes would be:

    <ul>
      <li><i>Introduction</i>: One or two sentences about what you're going to be presenting.</li>
      <li><i>2 Minutes</i>: Broader context of the problem. 
      <ul>
        <li>What is the software involved and <i>who uses it</i>?</li>
        <li>What is the particular area of the software that you've been working in? (i.e., the database layer, the reporting code, the front-end interface). Who uses this layer software? What is its significance to the project? What is its design philosophy? Its goals?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, if you are working on a bug-fix for a database library, explain the database library
      to us -- who uses it? Why? What is its overall design philosophy? How does it integrate with other components?</p>
      </li>

      <li><i>3 Minutes</i>: Technical overview of the feature, bug, or design
      task that you have been working on. Why is it important or necessary? How
      will it affect users? What technical details are involved? What are some
      of the risks and tradeoffs involved? What is interesting or hard about
      this problem? <b><i>If relevant, have code prepared to show.</i></b></li>

      <li><i>2-3 Minutes</i>: Your solution, even if its still in progress. Why
      did you make the choices you did. <i><b>Have code prepared to
          show</b></i></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Audience Role</h4>

    <p>The audience has the responsibility to ask questions which probe the
    design space and the presenters decisions. Avoid problem solving: this is a
    space to understand and critique a particular idea rather than solve
    problems.</p>

    <p>The second role of the audience is to provide feedback. Focus on how or
    why the proposed design is good or unfitting for the problem. This includes
    both technical (i.e., code technique) and design feedback.</p>

    <h4>Keep in Mind</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Be expedient and to the point.</li>

      <li>Appreciate and respect the profoundness of the mundane. Especially at
      MIT, we all have a tendency to disregard <i>technically easy things</i>
      as being uninteresting. Do not. We aren't interested in the technical
      difficulty of solutions here. We are interested if you picked <i>the
        right solution</i>. And the challenge of picking the right solution is
      nearly <i>always</i> interesting to talk about, even if all the choices
      you are choosing between are technically simple to implement.</li>
    </ul>
