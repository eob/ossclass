    <h1>Submitting Materials</h1>

    <p>We're going to try using the Google (GDocs, G+) ecosystem for materials
    submission for this class.

    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="status.html">Group Status Updates</a></b>: Create a new Google Document in your group folder in GDocs. Include the date in the document name. I.e., "Status Update 01-29-2013".</li>
      <li><b><a href="journal.html">Developer Journal</a></b>: Post to Google+ and share it just with <i>edward.benson@gmail.com</i>. (You're free to share with anyone you like, but you're only required to share with me.)</li>
