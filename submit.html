    <h2>Submitting Materials</h2>

    <p>We're going to try using the Google (GDocs, G+) ecosystem for materials
    submission for this class.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Group Status Updates</b>: Create a new Google Document in your group folder in GDocs. Include the date in the document name. I.e., "Status Update 01-29-2013"</li>
      <li><b>Developer Journal</b>: Post to Google+ and share it just with <i>edward.benson@gmail.com</i>. (You're free to share with anyone you like, but you're only required to share with me.)</li>
