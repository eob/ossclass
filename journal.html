    <h1>Development Journal</h1>

    <p><b>Goal.</b> Develop a practice of reflecting on areas of software
    development and your work.</p>

    <p><b>Guidelines.</b> Write as you would write an email or a memo to a
    colleague. That is: don't write an epic novel, but don't write a bullet-list
    of sentence fragments. Feel free to write a lot if the mood strikes you,
    but a few (2-3) paragraphs to a page is adequate.</p>

    <p>We'll often be providing you with a question, and sometimes a short
    piece of reading material to react to. In your reaction, we encourage you
    to think about big picture ideas in addition to the specifics of the
    question at hand.</p>

    <p><b>Submission.</b> Instructions <a href="submit.html">here</a>.</p>
