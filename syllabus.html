          <h3>Goal</h3> 
          
          <p>Software development outside of a university class involves code
          that spans decades (Windows is 27 years old!), teams that span
          countries, and a lot of bottom-up project management and
          decision-making. Our goal is to help you grow your software
          development skills by providing an experience that matches real world
          software development as closely as possible. Think of it as a bit of
          an internship during the semester, with a strong mentoring component.
          We hope that this will be a different kind of class, in a good
          way.</p>

          <h3>Format</h3>

          <p>This class is being taught in conjunction with several
          universities and open source projects. Each of you will be on a team
          with other students (from MIT and elsewhere) working on one of those
          open source projects. Your mentors will be me and a representative
          from the open source project. You can find the full list of projects
          and descriptions on the <b>Trip / Project Sign-up Form</b> (which has
          been emailed to you if you signed up).</p>

          <p>For the first few weeks, "normal" classes will be held Monday and
          Wednesday. These classes will take one of two formats:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Hands-on lectures (blend of lecture and class exercise), which will cover:
              <ul>
                <li>Project workflow with git</li>
                <li>Prototyping / software architecture skills</li>
                <li>Debugging Skills</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Guest lectures, which we expect to cover:
              <ul>
                <li>Open source business models</li>
                <li>Working with remote teams</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>After that, class will be used as a time for us to hold mentoring
          meetings, and occasionally as a time for you to reflect and present
          your work to the class.</p>

          <h3>Grading and Effort</h3>

          <p>The majority (70%) of your grade will be based on your "commits,"
          that is, the actual code contributions you make to the open source
          project you are working on and the overall project management process
          that you demonstrate. Our goal is to provide you a real-world
          learning experience, and so we are trying to grade you the way
          managers would.</p>

          <p>The rest of your grade (30%) will be based on class participation,
          attendance, group performance, and a few smaller assignments that we
          will do.</p>

          <p>Scoping the work (what to do, how much to do) is something each of
          you will be in charge of and we will help you with. We want you to
          work hard and be proud of shipping code that will actually get used.
          Each open source mentor has already compiled an introduction to the
          project and description of some project ideas for you, available on
          the <b>Trip/Project Sign-up form</b> (emailed to you).</p>

          <h3>Credit</h3>

          <p>This class provides 12 credits and 12 Engineering Design Points.
          It counts as a lab for EECS.</p>
