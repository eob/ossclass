Thanks for coming to the hackathon this weekend. Just a few reminders:

* Tomorrow is Monday schedule, so we have class.
* Journals are due at the start of class on Tuesday
* Status reports are due tonight for teams meeting tomorrow

We're going to delay the first studio critique -- so Rails and Phabricator, you're off the hook for Wednesday :) 

Instead, we'll use Wednesday's class to talk about what we'll be doing in the critiques, and as a group work time.
