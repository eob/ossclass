After looking over the survey results, we're going to have a mini hackathon
this Friday and Saturday. We're planning on providing food, music, and a place
to code two nights to make sure every group has a chance to come and work
together if you want. You're welcome to come to both if you want.

<ul>
  <li>Friday 2/15, 6PM - 11PM</li>
  <li>Saturday 2/16, 6PM - 11PM</li>
</ul>

The location is TBD. We'll likely reserve a room downstairs in Stata.

Many of the Open Source mentors have agreed to be available to video chat to
hang out with you and help out.  For each group, decide which times you are
able to come as a group, and email your mentor to let them know your plans so
they can sync up with you.

Attendence is optional, but we think you'll find this a good (and fun) way to
ramp up on your projects.
