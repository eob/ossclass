Hi Everyone,

On the <a href="/6.S194/calendar.html">calendar</a> I just posted the next
three weeks of assignments for the <a href="/6.S194/design-studio.html">design
studio</a>.

Small change of plans regarding presentation size: we're just going to have
solo presentations instead of allowing groups to come up and present. You can
still present work done as a pair, you'll just be presenting it solo. (We just
want to make sure everyone has the opportunity to practice presenting.)

For each group listed, pick one person to present something they've worked on.
Notice that your group will be sending someone up most weeks, so talk amongst
yourselves to decide when each of you wants to be the one to go up.

Slides are not necessary, but diagrams (whether on slides or the blackboard)
are encouraged if they help understand what you are presenting. Showing code
**is** necessary, which you can either do from an editor, or create a Github
gist to highlight the portion of code. More detailed guidelines on the <a
href="/6.S194/design-studio.html">design studio</a> page.
