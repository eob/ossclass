<h1>Everything you ever wanted to know about web requests</h1>

<p>The web presents a strange programming model because it forces you into writing
an application that runs on two computers at once. This presents a number of
challenges in application design and state management. All of these design
issues, however, are ultimately influenced and built on top of the fundamental
relationship that the browser has with the server.</p>

<p>The goal of this lesson is to fully describe that browser-server relationship.
If you understand the details about how the browser makes requests to the
server, you will be able to make better decisions when faced with higher-level
design choices.</p>

<p>We will target:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What's in a web request</li>
  <li>Life cycle of a web request</li>
  <li>Ajax and Ajax Styles</li>
  <li>The web security model</li>
</ul>
