<h1>Everything you ever wanted to know about web requests</h1>

<p>The web presents a strange programming model because it forces you into
writing an application that runs on two computers at once. This presents a
number of challenges in application design and state management. All of these
design issues, however, are ultimately influenced and built on top of the
fundamental relationship that the browser has with the server.</p>

<p>The goal of this lesson is to fully describe that browser-server
relationship.  If you understand the details about how the browser makes
requests to the server, you will be able to make better decisions when faced
with higher-level design choices.</p>

<p>We will target:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What's in a web request</li>
  <li>Life cycle of a web request</li>
  <li>Ajax and Ajax Styles</li>
  <li>The web security model</li>
</ul>

<h2>Journal Question</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>You're in charge of a five person team at a space company and have
  convinced your boss to let your next project, an operating system for
  satellites, be open source. As the technical lead of the project, you are
  responsible for setting the project workflow standards both for your team and
  for the community at large. How should code be written on your project? How,
  specifically, do people contribute? And just as importantly, why?</p>

  <p>This journal should be an internal email proposing your workflow design to
  your team and soliciting feedback from them.</p>
</div>

<p>Please submit your response by class time on each Monday. Here are the <a

<h2>Geek Cred</h2>

<p><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>, the Web that almost was</b></p>

<p>(from Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote> Gopher is a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed for
  distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. Strongly
  oriented towards a menu-document design, the Gopher protocol presented an
  alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages, but ultimately HTTP
  became the dominant protocol. The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the
  effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.</blockquote>
