<h1>Class 2: Bootup</h1>

Because of the staggered start of this class (hackathon at Facebook, etc),
different groups are at different stages. The goal of this class, and the
hackathon this weekend, is to provide time for everyone to reach highway speed
so that we're all even.

<h2>In Class</h2>

<p>We'll be handing out <a href="checklist.pdf">this checklist</a> for you to
fill out, due next Monday. This contains a set of goals, individual and
team-related, for you to make sure you're up and running with your project.</p>

<h2>Journal Question</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info">

<h2>Design Studio Crit</h2>

We'll start <b>next Wednesday (2/20)</b> with the design studio crit portion of
the course. First on the docket (randomly chosen) is <b>Rails</b> and
<b>Phabricator</b>. I'll be providing more information later this week about
the process and how to prepare.

<h2>Geek Cred</h2>

<ul>

  <li><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenet">Telenet</a></b>. These
  days, the "telnet" protocol is barely even uttered but even more distant in
  memory is "tel<b>e</b>net". Back in the day, long-distance telephone calls
  cost money, so you had to think about geography when visiting a
  bulletin-board system. Telenet acted as a worm-hole of sorts: you could hop
  on by dialing your nearest telenet machine, then route your way to another
  city and out to the computer you needed to connect to. Commonplace, now, but
  a big deal for consumers at the time.</li>
