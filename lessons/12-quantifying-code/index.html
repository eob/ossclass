<h2>Journal Question</h2>
<p><i>Due <b>When you get back</b> from spring break</i></p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h3>Quantifying your Project</h3>

  <p>Through measurement and reflection, we develop an understanding of how we
  might improve things.</p>

  <p>Propose <b>three</b> different metrics to measure on your code-base that
  would help generate a better understanding of how to improve the
  architecture. You might be measuring <i>time</i>, the <i>count</i> of
  something, or maybe the the distribution of parameters under which something
  occurs. For each proposal, explain what the metric is, how it relates to the
  project, what you might learn from measuring it, and what you might do with
  that information.</p>

<p>Please submit your response by class time on each Monday. Here are the <a
