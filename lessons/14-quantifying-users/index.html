<h2>Journal Question</h2>
<p><i>Due <b>next Monday</b></i></p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h3>Quantifying your project's users</h3>
 
  <p>This question is similar to last week's question, but focusing on user
  behavior.</p>

  <p>Propose <b>two</b> experiments that might shed useful light on how people
  <i>use</i> your project. What would you seek to understand? How would you
  design the experiment? What would different possible outcomes be and what
  would they mean? What would be complications/confounding factors that make
  interpreting the result difficult?</p>
  
  <p>Keep in mind that a "user" may be a developer. For example, you could
  propose measuring how many developers use a new API method you released. And
  you could provide different populations of developers with different
  announcements about the API (technical announcements, no announcement,
  announcements that have example code, announcements that have example
  benefits, etc).  </p>
 
<p>Please submit your response by class time on each Monday. Here are the <a
  href="../../journal.html">Journal guidelines</a> and <a
  href="../../submit.html">submission instructions</a>.</p>
