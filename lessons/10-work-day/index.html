<h1>Work Day</h1>

<p>We'll use today to sync up as a class, and within groups.</p>

<h2>Journal Question</h2>
<p><i>Due Monday, 3/18</i></p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h3>Reproducing Bugs</h3>

  <p>It's clear that the ability of users to report bugs, and developers to
  reproduce those bugs, is critically important to the development process.</p>

  <p>Each of you have now been in the situation of reading a bug report and
  attempting to reproduce the bug. In some cases, you were able to reproduce it
  easily. In other cases, it took a bit of work. Some of you have even
  encountered bugs that you are unable to reproduce, but may still exist.</p>

  <p>For this journal, I want you to think abstractly about the challenge of
  reporting and reproducing a program's state.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>For reporting</i>, what are ways programs help users to report bugs? How could they do better? What are the reporting challenges involved?</li>
    <li><i>For reproducing</i>, what are some of the challenges you've experienced? How might you improve this?</li>
  </ul>

</div>

<p>Please submit your response by class time on each Monday. Here are the <a
  href="../../journal.html">Journal guidelines</a> and <a
  href="../../submit.html">submission instructions</a>.</p>
