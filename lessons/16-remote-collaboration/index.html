<h1>Remote Collaboration</h1>

<p>Welcome and thank you to <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/marcua/">Adam
  Marcus</a>, who will be guest lecturing today!</p> 

<p>Adam is Director or Data at <a href="http://www.locu.com">Locu</a>, one of
the hottest startups in local data.  Behind the scenes, Adam designs and
coordinates an impressive pipeline using both crowd-sourced labor and machine
learning. While at MIT, Adam worked on a diverse range of research topics,
including web data storage, web application optimization, computer assisted
reporting, and the intersection of crowd-sourcing and database algorithms.</p>

  talk</a> by <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan
  Zittrain</a> about some of the coming ethical questions surrounding crowd
labor.</p>

<h2>Journal Question</h2>
<p><i>Due <b>next Monday</b></i></p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h3>Pick one of the questions below and answer in a ~half page response</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>What labor issues arise with crowd labor? Do these labor issues affect program correctness? Do they introduce ethical obligations for developers?</li>
    <li>What data quality issues might arise with finely-grained crowdsourced labor? How could you mitigate this. <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/other-pubs/soylent.pdf">Here's an interesting paper</a> if you're interested in this question.</li>
    <li>How do you break a big problem down into an automated sequence of little ones?</li>
    <li>How can machine learning and crowd-sourcing interact to produce a more robust system? If you're trying to label images of cats, and you have one black box that does it via Mechanical Turk, and another black box that does it with machine learning, how do you decide which to use? Can you leverage them together?</li>
  </ul>

<p>Please submit your response by class time on each Monday. Here are the <a
  href="../../journal.html">Journal guidelines</a> and <a
  href="../../submit.html">submission instructions</a>.</p>
