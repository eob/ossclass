<p>Disclaimer: This exercise page functions as a compliment to what
we'll be doing together in class. It won't work stand-alone</p>

<h2>Fork and Clone the Hackathon Repo</h2>

First, split up in pairs again for error redundancy :).

<ol>
  <li>Go to
<code>http://github.com/software-development/hackathon</code>. Fork it
to your own account (e.g., <code>eob/hackathon</code>)</li>
<li>Now clone your copy of the repository down to your own computer</li>
</ol>

<p><i>On Board:</i> What team structure did we just create?</p>

<h2>Create a new branch for your change</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create a branch for your change. Name it appropriately</li>
  <li>Add your pizza request</li>
  <li>Push your changes up to your github repo</li>
</ol>

<p><i>On Projector:</i> Explore some changes on Github.</p>

<h2>Create a pull request</h2>

<p>We'll look at some of these in Github and merge them in.</p>

<h2>What about the other pull requests?</h2>

<p>They're out of date now that we've begin changing the official
repository.</p>

<p>First, add the official repository as a read-only remote.</p>

<pre> git remote add official git://github.com/software-development/hackathon.git</pre>

<p>Next, bring your local <b>master</b> up to date.</p>

<pre>
git checkout master
git pull official master</pre>

<p>And while you're at it, might as will push those changes up to your github Repo</p>

<pre>
git push origin master</pre>

<p>Now, you can rebase your feature branch with the new official master</p>

<pre>
git checkout eob-pizza-request
git rebase master
</pre>

<p>You'll be prompted to add and resolve any conflicts.</p>

<p>When you're done, try to push that up to your request branch</p>

<pre>
git push origin eob-pizza-request
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-error">
  <p>It fails: <b><i>why?</i></b></p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss: Rebasing to keep in track <i>before</i> you publish your change</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's delete that remote branch and pretend it never existed.</p>

<p>This is the unfortunately awkward command to delete a remote branch:</p>

<pre>
git push origin :eob-pizza-request</pre>

<p>Now try pushing your feature branch up again:</p>

<pre>
git push origin eob-pizza-request</pre>

<p>Now try that pull request again.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss: But what about once you've issued the pull request? How do update without deleting?</li>
</ul>
