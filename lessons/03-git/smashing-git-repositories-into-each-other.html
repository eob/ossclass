<h1>Giant Git Repositories Smashing Into Other Giant Git Repositories</h1>

<p>This exercise shows you that, at heart, git truly is just a giant object
graph.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Clone the Patriot Act</h2>

<p>Clone a <a href="https://github.com/software-development/patriot-act">repository with The Patriot Act in it.</a></p>

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/software-development/patriot-act.git 
</pre>

<p>Take a peek at the files in this directory:</p>

<pre>
  + patriot-act
  |
  | - README.md
  | - all-different.txt
  | - append.txt
  | - hr3162.txt
  | - same.txt
</pre>

<p>Two of these files, `README.md` and `hr3162.txt` are realted the USA Patriot
Act. The rest of the files are simply here to help you investigate the behavior
of git.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Clone Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis</h2>

<p>Next, in a new folder, clone a second <a href="https://github.com/software-development/kafka">repository with Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis</a>.</p>

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/software-development/kafka.git
</pre>

<p>Take a peek at those files, too.</p>

<pre>
  + kafka
  |
  | - README.txt
  | - all-different.txt
  | - append.txt
  | - metamorphosis.txt
  | - same.txt
</pre>

<h2>Step 3: Notice the Differences</h2>

<p>Explore the differences in the two repositories. Some are simply different
files, but others content differences within files of the same name.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  
  What do you think would happen, <b>file per file</b>, if you try to pull the
  Kafka repository into Patriot Act repository?

</div>

<h2>Step 4: Super Smash Bros.</h2>

First, create a <i>new clone</i> of the Patriot Act repository (so you'll be
able to compare it to the old one.)

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/software-development/patriot-act.git patriot2
</pre>

Notice how we added a final argument this time arount -- <b>patriot2</b> --
which manually provides the name we want to give this repository. Change
directories into this new <b>patriot2</b> repository.

Next, let's add a shortcut to the Kafka repository from inside <b>patriot2</b>:

<pre>
git remote add kafka git://github.com/software-development/kafka.git
</pre>

<p>Recall that a <b>remote</b> in git is just like a nick-name for some other
repository. The configuration for remotes are stored in `.git/config`. You can
see the configuration for the new remote you just added by typing:</p>

<pre>
cat .git/config
</pre>

<p>Now pull from the remote <b>kafka</b> repository on Github into the local
<b>patriot2</b> repository on your disk.</p>

<pre>
git pull kafka master
</pre>

You'll see the following message:

<pre>
From git://github.com/software-development/kafka
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging append.txt
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in append.txt
Auto-merging all-different.txt
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in all-different.txt
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
</pre>

<h2>Step 5: What happened?</h2>

Inspect the files in your repository again, both their names and contents. Come
up with an explanation for why each file currently in the repository is in its
current state:

<ul>
  <li>README.md</li>
  <li>all-different.txt</li>
  <li>append.txt</li>
  <li>hr3162.txt</li>
  <li>metamorphosis.txt</li>
  <li>same.txt</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">

  You just smashed two repositories into each other.
  
  <ul>
    <li>Why is this even possible? </li>
    <li>What does the git object graph look like?</li>
    <li>How do you patch up the state of these conflicting files?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
