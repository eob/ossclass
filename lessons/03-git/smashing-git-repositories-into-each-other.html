<p>This exercise shows you that, at heart, git truly is just a giant object
graph.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Clone the Patriot Act</h2>

<p>Clone a <a href="https://github.com/software-development/patriot-act">repository with The Patriot Act in it.</a></p>

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/software-development/patriot-act.git 
</pre>

<p>Take a peek at the files in this directory:</p>

<pre>
  + patriot-act
  |
  | - README.md
  | - all-different.txt
  | - append.txt
  | - hr3162.txt
  | - same.txt
</pre>

<p>Two of these files, `README.md` and `hr3162.txt` are realted the USA Patriot
Act. The rest of the files are simply here to help you investigate the behavior
of git.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Clone Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis</h2>

<p>Next, in a new folder, clone a second <a href="https://github.com/software-development/kafka">repository with Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis</a>.</p>

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/software-development/kafka.git
</pre>

<p>Take a peek at those files, too.</p>

<pre>
  + kafka
  |
  | - README.txt
  | - all-different.txt
  | - append.txt
  | - metamorphosis.txt
  | - same.txt
</pre>

<h2>Step 3: Notice the Differences</h2>

<p>Explore the differences in the two repositories. Some are simply different
files, but others content differences within files of the same name.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  
  What do you think would happen, <b>file per file</b>, if you try to pull the
  Kafka repository into Patriot Act repository?

</div>

<h2>Step 4: Super Smash Bros.</h2>

First, create a <i>new clone</i> of the Patriot Act repository (so you'll be
able to compare it to the old one.)

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/software-development/patriot-act.git patriot2
</pre>

Notice how we added a final argument this time arount -- <b>patriot2</b> --
which manually provides the name we want to give this repository. Change
directories into this new <b>patriot2</b> repository.

Next, let's add a shortcut to the Kafka repository from inside <b>patriot2</b>:

<pre>
git remote add kafka git://github.com/software-development/kafka.git
</pre>

<p>Recall that a <b>remote</b> in git is just like a nick-name for some other
repository. The configuration for remotes are stored in `.git/config`. You can
see the configuration for the new remote you just added by typing:</p>

<pre>
cat .git/config
</pre>

<p>Now pull from the remote <b>kafka</b> repository on Github into the local
<b>patriot2</b> repository on your disk.</p>

<pre>
git pull kafka master
</pre>

You'll see the following message:

<pre>
From git://github.com/software-development/kafka
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging append.txt
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in append.txt
Auto-merging all-different.txt
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in all-different.txt
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
</pre>

<h2>Step 5: Cleaning Up The Mess</h2>

<p>Inspect the files in your repository again, both their names and
contents. Come up with an explanation for why each file currently in the
repository is in its current state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>README.md</li>
  <li>all-different.txt</li>
  <li>append.txt</li>
  <li>hr3162.txt</li>
  <li>metamorphosis.txt</li>
  <li>same.txt</li>
</ul>

<p>Now run a <code>git status</code> command.</p>

<p>What you are seeing in some of them is git's way of showing you a
file it doesn't know how to merge:</p>

<pre>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  HEAD
Why did the chicken cross the road?
=======
to get to the other side
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 18b5e56bc02acbc17e67a7849d467efc1c79a5d0
</pre>

<p>The &lt;&lt; bit and the &gt;&gt; bit enclose the region with
differences, and the equal signs divide it into two. On the top, we see
the <code>HEAD</code>'s version of what should be there (this is your
local repository. On the bottom we see commit <code>18b5e5</code>'s
version. What you pulled in.</p>

<p>Fix these conflicting files, then tell git that you've solved all the problems by <code>git add</code>ing them and committing that changeset with the log message "Reconciled differences"</p>

<h2>Step 6: Lookng Back</h2>

<p>Now that you've reconciled, and committed, the differences, Let's
take a visual look at what's going on in there. The <code>git
  log</code> command will show you a simple picture of what's going on.
Try typing that.</p>

<p>We can do better than that, though. Add the following to your
<code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>

<pre>
[alias]
lg1 = log --graph --all --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(bold white)— %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --abbrev-commit --date=relative
lg2 = log --graph --all --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold cyan)%aD%C(reset) %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)%n''          %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(bold white)— %an%C(reset)' --abbrev-commit
lg = !"git lg2"
</pre>

<p>This will let you type <code>git lg</code> for a more visual
depiction of what is going on (showing branches, etc).</p>

</pre>

<p>You're at the head -- the top line -- and you now have two parents!</p>

<p>Try moving between them and verifying (via <code>ls</code> and file inspection) that you truly have <b>both</b> the Patriot Act and Metamorphosis as separate parents!</p>
<ul>
  <li>git checkout 8708113</li>
  <li>git checkout 9b5d3bd</li>
  <li>git checkout master</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>You just smashed two repositories into each other.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Why is this even possible? </li>
    <li>What does the git object graph look like?</li>
    <li>How do you patch up the state of these conflicting files?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Hopefully, this exercize has shown you that a "repository" in git is
far more flexible a data structure than you may have believed!</p>
