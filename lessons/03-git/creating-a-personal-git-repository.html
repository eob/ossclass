title: Creating a Personal Git Repo on Athena
exercise: 03-git
---

<h1>Creating and Using a Personal Git Repo over SSH</h1>

<p>For this tutorial, we'll be using your Athena account to host a git repository,
but any system that you have access to over ssh will do. (For example,
`login.csail.mit.edu`).</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>First,</b> pair up with someone from a
  different group project than you.</div>

<h2>1. Creating a Git Repository</h2>

<p>Git doesn't have separate notions of "central repository" and "client checkout"
like centralized version control systems. All participants in the ecosystem
have copies of a full working repository. But there are several ways to create
a repository, including:</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>1. Create from Scratch</th>
    <td><p>Initialize an empty git workspace, with the database in the `.git` folder.</p><p>Use when you are creating a repository on your local system.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>2. Create from Scratch<br /><b>bare</b> mode</th>
    <td><p>Initializes an empty git database</p><p>Use when you are creating a repository on a server to act as a remote.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>3. Clone</th>
    <td>Copies an existing repository.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We'll be using the second and third method in this exercise.

<ol>
  <li>Log in to Athena using <a href="https://linerva.mit.edu/">the web interface</a> or ssh, whichever you prefer.</li>
  <li>Create a directory called <b>git</b> to hold your repositories. (The name of this directory isn't important. You can call it <b>rutabega</b> if you want.) And change directories there.
    <pre>
    eob@dr-wily:~$ <span class="impcode">mkdir git</span>
    eob@dr-wily:~$ <span class="impcode">cd git</span></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Next we'll create a directory for our new repository. Because we don't intend to actually <i>develop</i> out of this directory, we'll create a <b>bare</b> repository. The convention for creating bare repositories is to append `.git` to their name, as in `REPONAME.git`. Let's call the repository <b>filebox.git</b>. Change directories into it after you've created it.
    <pre>
    eob@dr-wily:~/git$ <span class="impcode">mkdir filebox.git</span>
    eob@dr-wily:~/git$ <span class="impcode">cd filebox.git/</span></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, create the repository!
  <pre>
  <span class="impcode">git init --bare</span></pre>
  </li>
  <li>That's it, you've just created a <b>bare</b> repository (the second method in the table above).</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. What hath git wroght?</h2>

<p>That git command just dumped a brand new, shiny git database straight into your
`~/git/filebox.git` directory in Athena.</p>

<pre>
eob@dr-wily:~/git/filebox.git$ <span class="impcode">ls -l</span>
total 13
drwxr-xr-x 2 eob mit 2048 Feb 11 19:24 branches
-rw-r--r-- 1 eob mit   66 Feb 11 19:24 config
-rw-r--r-- 1 eob mit   73 Feb 11 19:24 description
-rw-r--r-- 1 eob mit   23 Feb 11 19:24 HEAD
drwxr-xr-x 2 eob mit 2048 Feb 11 19:24 hooks
drwxr-xr-x 2 eob mit 2048 Feb 11 19:24 info
drwxr-xr-x 4 eob mit 2048 Feb 11 19:24 objects
drwxr-xr-x 4 eob mit 2048 Feb 11 19:24 refs
</pre>

<p>Take a minute and poke around. This is an <i>empty repository</i>, so there
isn't much to see, but you can start to get a feel for what, exactly, git does
behind the scenes. For instance, you infer from the directory listing where git
stores your branches. Take a look inside the `HEAD` file and you'll see that
it's essentially a pointer into elsewhere in this directory structure. The git
"database" is really just a bunch of carefully organized files!</p>

<h2>3. Putting it to use</h2>

<p>Back on your own machine (not Athena), let's clone this repo. Open up a
terminal on your computer and change to a directory that you don't mind messing
around in.</p>

<p>Now, assuming that you've named everything the same as I have, issue
the following command (<i>you'll have to change the username</i>:</p>

<pre>
localhost:Code eob$ <span class="impcode">git clone eob@linerva.mit.edu:~/git/filebox.git</span>
Cloning into 'filebox'...
Password: 
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
localhost:Code eob$ 
</pre> 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <b>In Class</b>: Discuss <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html#URLS">git URLs</a>. Show <b>scp</b>.
  <ul>
    <li>SSH: user@server:/path.git</li>
    <li>http(s)://domain/path/to/repo.git</li>
    <li>git://github.com/schacon/grit.git</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>You get a warning because you've cloned an empty repository, but that's ok.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try creating a file, `index.html` and filling it with some content:
  <pre>
  &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;</pre></li>
  <li>Then check that in and push it up to the repository.
  <pre>
  git add index.html
  git commit -m "Initial checkin"
  git push origin master
  </pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- 
<h2>4. Ex</h2>

<p>Since this repository is being accessed over SSH, sharing it with others is
really more of a permissions issue on the remote system. Share the repository
with your partner by typing the following AFS command <b>on the Athena
  terminal</b> (not on your local machine):</p>

<pre>
add consult
fsr sa ~/git/filebox.git OTHER_USER_NAME write</pre>

Now you can inspect the permissions with

<pre>
fsr la ~/git/filebox.git</pre>

to make sure they have been set correctly.

git clone oshani@linerva.mit.edu:/afs/athena.mit.edu/user/e/o/eob/git/filebox.git
