title: How to Add Post Commit Hooks
exercise: 03-git

<h1>Hooking Custom Functionality into the Git Pipeline</h1>

<p>Git (like many other version control systems) support custom script triggers
through <b>hooks</b>. These hooks give you a change to inject functionality at
particular points in the standard pipeline:</p>

<ol style="margin-left: 40px">
  <li>Before committing ("<b>pre-commit</b>")</li>
  <li>Before writing a commit message ("<b>prepare-commit-msg</b>")</li>
  <li>After writing a commit message ("<b>commit-msg</b>")</li>
  <li>After committing ("<b>post-commit</b>")</li>
  <li>Before a rebase ("<b>pre-rebase</b>")</li>
  <li>After a checkout ("<b>post-checkout</b>")</li>
  <li>After a merge ("<b>post-merge</b>")</li>
  <li>Before receiving a push ("<b>pre-receive</b>")</li>
  <li>After receiving a push ("<b>post-receive</b>")</li>
  <li>Before receiving a push, run once per branch ("<b>update</b>")</li>
</ol>

<p>To add a hook, place a file with the hook name in <code>.git/hooks/</code>.
Every git repository comes with several sample files already there to provide
example usage. Depending on the hook, git may pass in command line arguments
with information, such as a file pointer to the commit message or a list of the
files about to be committed.</p>

<p>Hooks that start with <b>pre-</b> can generally abort whatever operation is
in place by returning a non-zero exit code. <i>Why might you do this?</i></p>

<h2>A Simple Hook: Displaying a Banner</h2>

Go to one of the repositories you've created from an earlier exercise and
create a <b>post-commit</b> hook that displays a congratulatory banner, such as
the following:

<pre class="sh_python">
#!/usr/bin/python

print "3.. 2.. 1.. LIFTOFF!!"</pre>

Play around to see that it works.

<h3>Preventing a Commit</h3>

<p>Now let's try preventing <b>ALL</b> commits. Add a <b>pre-commit</b> hook
that simply returns a non-zero exit code:</p>

<pre class="sh_python">
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
print "No soup for you!"

# In *nix systems, an "exit code" of 0 means
# that execution happened sucessfully, whereas a nonzero
# exit code indicates an error.
#
# In python, you can return an exit code with sys.exit(CODE)
sys.exit(-1)
</pre>

<p>Try changing a file and committing that change to the repository. What happens?
Check the staging area with <code>git status</code> to verify that the commit
didn't go through.</p>

<p>Let's change that hook to something a little more reasonable: a math puzzle.
You're going to have to do a bit of a hack re-routing <b>stdin</b> to accept
user input. Here's one math puzzle; try your own.</p>

<pre class="sh_python">
#!/usr/bin/python

import random
import sys

x = random.randint(1,10)
y = random.randint(1,10)

# This is required because git hooks are run in non-interactive
# mode. You aren't technically supposed to have access to stdin.
# This hack works on MaxOS and Linux. Mileage may vary on Windows.
sys.stdin = open('/dev/tty')

result = input("What is %d * %s:" % (x, y))

if int(result) == x * y:
  sys.exit(0)
else:
  print "INCORRECT!"
  sys.exit(-1)
</pre>

<p>Now try committing again. Verify that the commit is allowed when you get the
puzzle right, and rejected when you are wrong.</p>

<h3>More Reasonable Interrogation</h3>

<p>Talk about some circumstances you can imagine <i>wanting</i> to prevent a
commit. Anything here seem familiar to anyone with internships at a big company
like Google?</p>

<h2>Server-side Hooks</h2>

<p>You can add hooks on the server-side, too. Go back to the repository you
created on Athena and try adding the following post-update hook:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
git show --name-status | mail -s "Received Push" eob@csail.mit.edu</pre>

<p>See if you can figure out what it is going to do before pushing changes up
to your Athena repository to find out. <i>When might you want to be running
  hooks on a shared server, instead of a developer machine?</i></p>

<h3>Simulating Github Pages</h3>

<p>You are only about 10 minutes of work away from creating a simple version of
<a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. <i>How would you go about
  this?</i></p>

<p> We won't do it in class, because it involves writing a script that deletes
files, and that is, ahem, dangerous, but this can be a convenient way to let a
group of people update a simple website.</p>

<script>
  sh_highlightDocument();
</script>
