<h1>What to do when you think you are going crazy</h1>

<p>You've had that feeling before: it's late, you're debugging a pset, and
you're convinced that the only possible reason your code is failing is because
neutrinos keep hitting your CPU and flipping bits at exactly the moment you run
the program. Each time. The code is perfect! Why is the answer wrong?!</p>

<p>This exercise will help you practice what to do in that situation. It
surrounds a credit card processing algorithm called the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">Lunh Algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>Please debug <a href="files/crazy.rb">this credit processing
  program</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some credit card numbers that should pass the Lunh Check, for your
testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>378282246310005 (American Express)</li>
  <li>30569309025904 (Diners Club)</li>
  <li>6011111111111117 (Discover)</li>
  <li>4111111111111111 (Visa)</li>
  <li>5105105105105100 (MasterCard)</li>
</ul>
