<h1>Debugging</h1>

<p>Everybody knows the standard list of bugs that an Introduction to
Programming textbook will teach you:
<ul>
  <li>Off by one errors</li>
  <li>Memory management bugs</li>
  <li>Uninitialized variables</li>
  <li>Unvalidated input</li>
  <li>Null values</li>
  <li><i>... and so on</i></li>
</ul>

<p>This lesson has two goals:
<ul>
  <li>Fun puzzlers to get you thinking about more subtle errors that often happen</li>
  <li>Use those puzzlers as an excuse to talk about general bug catching strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>The languages and environments for the puzzles are intentionally varied to
make sure that, for at least some exercises, you'll have to practice debugging
outside your linguistic comfort zone.</p>

<h2>The Lineup</h2>

  one person with Linux/Mac per group</i></p>

<h2>Journal Question</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info">

  <p>At this point, all of you have been spelunking in fairly large codebase
  for a few weeks. You've skimmed code, read code, written code, compiled code,
  and used the <code>grep</code> and <code>find</code> commands more than you
  probably expected you would.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What are some <b>specific</b> debugging challenges particular to your
  project? Think about its project organization, code design, runtime
  architecture, test suites, etc.</li>
    <li>Given that they exist, how could one or two of these challenges be mitigated by a developer on the project like you? What processes or techniques could you apply?</li>
    <li>Could any of these challenges be eliminated alltogether? If so, what would the tradeoffs of that be?</li>
  </ul>
