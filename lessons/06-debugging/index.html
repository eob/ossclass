<h1>Debugging</h1>

<p>Everybody knows the standard list of bugs that an Introduction to
Programming textbook will teach you:
<ul>
  <li>Off by one errors</li>
  <li>Memory management bugs</li>
  <li>Uninitialized variables</li>
  <li>Unvalidated input</li>
  <li>Null values</li>
  <li><i>... and so on</i></li>
</ul>

<p>This lesson has two goals:
<ul>
  <li>Fun puzzlers to get you thinking about more subtle errors that often happen</li>
  <li>Use those puzzlers as an excuse to talk about general bug catching strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>The languages and environments for the puzzles are intentionally varied to
make sure that, for at least some exercises, you'll have to practice debugging
outside your linguistic comfort zone.</p>

<h2>The Lineup</h2>

<p><i>Please pair up in groups of 3. Have at least one person with NodeJS and
  one person with Linux/Mac per group</i></p>

<ul>
  <li><h3>When things don't go as expected</h3><p><i>... Developing a hound's node for sniffing out errors, even when they're invisible.</i></p>
    <ul>

      <li>Discussion: bug hunting strategies when it isn't clear what's wrong, developing a "scent" for what code is doing even if you didn't write it.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><h3>Debugging distributed systems</h3><p><i>... When code no longer executes serially</i></p>

</ul>

<h2>Journal Question</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info">

  <p>At this point, all of you have been spelunking in fairly large codebase
  for a few weeks. You've skimmed code, read code, written code, compiled code,
  and used the <code>grep</code> and <code>find</code> commands more than you
  probably expected you would.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What are some <b>specific</b> debugging challenges particular to your
  project? Think about its project organization, code design, runtime
  architecture, test suites, etc.</li>
    <li>Given that they exist, how could one or two of these challenges be mitigated by a developer on the project like you? What processes or techniques could you apply?</li>
    <li>Could any of these challenges be eliminated alltogether? If so, what would the tradeoffs of that be?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Please submit your response by class time on each Monday. Here are the <a
  href="../../journal.html">Journal guidelines</a> and <a
  href="../../submit.html">submission instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Geek Cred</h2>

<p><b>Monkey Patching</b> (also known as duck puntching) refers to the process
of modifying code while a program is running. It is both powerful, dangerous,
and controversial. Monkey patching is one of the reasons Ruby on Rails is able
to do so pmany "magical" things with its API. This is possible because the Ruby
language allows object definitions to be modified at runtime.</p>

<p>The term, hilariously, comes from <i>guerilla patching</i> (sneaking code in
at runtime like a military guerilla), which sounds like gorilla, which became
monkey.</p>

<p>"Duck punching" has a similarly amusing etymology. Duck Typing ("if it walks
like a duck, and talks like a duck, it is a duck") is a practice in which
objects are dynamically typed based on their properties (variables and methods)
rather than a static type assignment (e.g., `Duck d = new Duck()`). But say you
have a cow, but wanted a duck. You can just "punch" the cow (at run time) with
new code and force it to walk like a duck.</p>
