<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

<p align="center"><img style="max-width: 500px" src="files/turk-engraving.jpg" /></p>

<p>The mysterious fortune telling machine knows. But underneath its mannequin
exterior, there is a bug preventing it from working. The fortune teller seems
to have the same questions you do.</p>

<p>Debug the <a href="files/who-am-i.html">Fortune Telling Website</a></p>

<p>To do this locally, you'll need to download three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="files/who-am-i.html">who-am-i.html</a></li>
  <li><a href="files/fortunes.js">fortunes.js</a></li>
  <li><a href="files/fortune-teller.js">fortune-teller.js</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To debug, rather than opening them directly from your filesystem, run
<code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> from the directory you've downloded
them into. You can then load the file in your browser at
<code>http://localhost/who-am-i.html</code>.
