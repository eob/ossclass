    <h1>Status Updates</h1>
    
    <p>Weekly status updates are designed to get you into the habit of
    <b>planning, scoping, evaluating, and reflecting upon</b> your work in the
    way that you will be expected to in industry. Each week, by midnight the
    day before your group meeting, each group should create a Google Doc in
    your group folder that answers the following questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What did you accomplish last week?</li>
      <li>What new information do you have?</li>
      <li>What are you planning for this week?</li>
      <li>What is blocking you?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a detailed discussion of these questions, see <a href="/6.S194/lessons/01-introduction/outroduction.html#/5">these slides</a>. Please place initials by line items to mark who they pertain to.</p>
